Functions and Errors

This project is a basic implementation of an ERC20-like token contract in Solidity. It allows a token owner to mint, burn, and transfer tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

Minting Tokens: The owner can create new tokens and assign them to any address, increasing the total supply. Burning Tokens: The owner can destroy tokens from any address, reducing the total supply. Transferring Tokens: Users can transfer tokens from their address to another, allowing the tokens to circulate between different participants. Purpose The contract demonstrates essential features of a cryptocurrency or token system, typically used in decentralized applications (dApps), gaming, or other blockchain-based ecosystems. The project is suitable for those learning blockchain development, token economics, or deploying custom tokens in decentralized finance (DeFi) or gaming applications.
